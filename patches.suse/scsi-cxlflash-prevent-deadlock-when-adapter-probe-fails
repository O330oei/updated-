Subject: scsi: cxlflash: Prevent deadlock when adapter probe fails
Git-commit: bb61b843ffd46978d7ca5095453e572714934eeb
Patch-mainline: v5.0-rc6
References: git-fixes

Presently when an error is encountered during probe of the cxlflash
adapter, a deadlock is seen with cpu thread stuck inside
cxlflash_remove(). Below is the trace of the deadlock as logged by
khungtaskd:

cxlflash 0006:00:00.0: cxlflash_probe: init_afu failed rc=-16
INFO: task kworker/80:1:890 blocked for more than 120 seconds.

INFO: task systemd-udevd:5160 blocked for more than 120 seconds.

The deadlock occurs as cxlflash_remove() is called from cxlflash_probe()
without setting 'cxlflash_cfg->state' to STATE_PROBED and the probe thread
starts to wait on 'cxlflash_cfg->reset_waitq'. Since the device was never
successfully probed the 'cxlflash_cfg->state' never changes from
STATE_PROBING hence the deadlock occurs.

We fix this deadlock by setting the variable 'cxlflash_cfg->state' to
STATE_PROBED in case an error occurs during cxlflash_probe() and just
before calling cxlflash_remove().
