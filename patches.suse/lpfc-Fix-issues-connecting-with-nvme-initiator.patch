Subject: [PATCH] scsi: lpfc: Fix issues connecting with nvme initiator
References: bsc#1076693
Git-commit: e06351a002214d152142906a546006e3446d1ef7
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1

In the lpfc discovery engine, when as a nvme target, where the driver
was performing mailbox io with the adapter for port login when a NVME
PRLI is received from the host. Rather than queue and eventually get
back to sending a response after the mailbox traffic, the driver
rejected the io with an error response.

Turns out this particular initiator didn't like the rejection values
(unable to process command/command in progress) so it never attempted a
retry of the PRLI. Thus the host never established nvme connectivity
with the lpfc target.

By changing the rejection values (to Logical Busy/nothing more), the
initiator accepted the response and would retry the PRLI, resulting in
nvme connectivity.
