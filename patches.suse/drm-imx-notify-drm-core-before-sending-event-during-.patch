Subject: drm/imx: notify drm core before sending event during crtc disable
Git-commit: 78c68e8f5cd24bd32ba4ca1cdfb0c30cf0642685
Patch-mainline: v5.2
References: bsc#1135642

Notify drm core before sending pending events during crtc disable.
This fixes the first event after disable having an old stale timestamp
by having drm_crtc_vblank_off update the timestamp to now.

This was seen while debugging weston log message:
Warning: computed repaint delay is insane: -8212 msec

This occurred due to:
1. driver starts up
2. fbcon comes along and restores fbdev, enabling vblank
3. vblank_disable_fn fires via timer disabling vblank, keeping vblank
seq number and time set at current value
(some time later)
4. weston starts and does a modeset
5. atomic commit disables crtc while it does the modeset
6. ipu_crtc_atomic_disable sends vblank with old seq number and time

Fixes: a474478642d5 ("drm/imx: fix crtc vblank state regression")
