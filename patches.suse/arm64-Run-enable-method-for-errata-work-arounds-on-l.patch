Subject: arm64: Run enable method for errata work arounds on late CPUs
Git-commit: 55b35d070c2534dfb714b883f3c3ae05d02032da
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: bsc#1068032

When a CPU is brought up after we have finalised the system
wide capabilities (i.e, features and errata), we make sure the
new CPU doesn't need a new errata work around which has not been
detected already. However we don't run enable() method on the new
CPU for the errata work arounds already detected. This could
cause the new CPU running without potential work arounds.
It is upto the "enable()" method to decide if this CPU should
do something about the errata.

Fixes: commit 6a6efbb45b7d95c84 ("arm64: Verify CPU errata work arounds on hotplugged CPU")
