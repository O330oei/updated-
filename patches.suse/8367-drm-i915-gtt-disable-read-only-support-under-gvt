Subject: [PATCH 03/23] drm/i915/gtt: Disable read-only support under GVT
References: CVE-2019-0154,bsc#1135966,CVE-2019-0155,bsc#1135967
Patch-mainline: v4.19-rc1
Git-commit: c9e666880de5a1fed04dc412b046916d542b72dd

GVT is not propagating the PTE bits, and is always setting the
read-write bit, thus breaking read-only support.
