Subject: [PATCH] drm/nouveau/i2c: Enable i2c pads & busses during preinit
Git-commit: 7cb95eeea6706c790571042a06782e378b2561ea
Patch-mainline: v5.3-rc1
References: bsc#1051510

It turns out that while disabling i2c bus access from software when the
GPU is suspended was a step in the right direction with:

commit 342406e4fbba ("drm/nouveau/i2c: Disable i2c bus access after
->fini()")

We also ended up accidentally breaking the vbios init scripts on some
older Tesla GPUs, as apparently said scripts can actually use the i2c
bus. Since these scripts are executed before initializing any
subdevices, we end up failing to acquire access to the i2c bus which has
left a number of cards with their fan controllers uninitialized. Luckily
this doesn't break hardware - it just means the fan gets stuck at 100%.

This also means that we've always been using our i2c busses before
initializing them during the init scripts for older GPUs, we just didn't
notice it until we started preventing them from being used until init.
It's pretty impressive this never caused us any issues before!

So, fix this by initializing our i2c pad and busses during subdev
pre-init. We skip initializing aux busses during pre-init, as those are
guaranteed to only ever be used by nouveau for DP aux transactions.
