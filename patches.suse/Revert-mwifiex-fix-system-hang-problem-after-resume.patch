Subject: [PATCH] Revert "mwifiex: fix system hang problem after resume"
Git-commit: 654026df2635863fd695b2ca833e5c62454bd5ee
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
References: bsc#1051510

This reverts commit 437322ea2a36d112e20aa7282c869bf924b3a836.

This above-mentioned "fix" does not actually do anything to prevent a
race condition. It simply papers over it so that the issue doesn't
appear.

If this is a real problem, it should be explained better than the above
commit does, and an alternative, non-racy solution should be found.

For further reason to revert this: there's no reason we can't try
resetting the card when it's *actually* stuck in host-sleep mode. So
instead, this is unnecessarily creating scenarios where we can't recover
Wifi (and in fact, I'm fielding reports of Chromebooks that can't
recover after the aforementioned commit).

Note that this was proposed in 2017 and Ack'ed then, but due to my
marking as RFC, it never went anywhere:
