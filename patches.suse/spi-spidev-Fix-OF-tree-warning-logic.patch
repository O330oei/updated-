Subject: [PATCH] spi: spidev: Fix OF tree warning logic

References: bsc#1051510

spidev will make a big fuss if a device tree node binds a device by
using "spidev" as the node's compatible property.

However, the logic for this isn't looking for "spidev" in the
compatible, but rather checking that the device is NOT compatible with
spidev's list of devices.

This causes a false positive if a device not named "rohm,dh2228fv", etc.
binds to spidev, even if a means other than putting "spidev" in the
device tree was used.  E.g., the sysfs driver_override attribute.
