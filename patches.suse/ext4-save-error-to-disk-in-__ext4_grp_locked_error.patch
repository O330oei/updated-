Subject: [PATCH] ext4: save error to disk in __ext4_grp_locked_error()
Git-commit: 06f29cc81f0350261f59643a505010531130eea0
Patch-mainline: v4.16-rc1
References: bsc#1052766

In the function __ext4_grp_locked_error(), __save_error_info()
is called to save error info in super block block, but does not sync
that information to disk to info the subsequence fsck after reboot.

This patch writes the error information to disk.  After this patch,
I think there is no obvious EXT4 error handle branches which leads to
"Remounting filesystem read-only" will leave the disk partition miss
the subsequence fsck.
