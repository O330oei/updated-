Subject: [PATCH] macvlan: schedule bc_work even if error
Git-commit: 1d7ea55668878bb350979c377fc72509dd6f5b21
Patch-mainline: v5.5-rc1
References: bsc#1051510

While enqueueing a broadcast skb to port->bc_queue, schedule_work()
is called to add port->bc_work, which processes the skbs in
bc_queue, to "events" work queue. If port->bc_queue is full, the
skb will be discarded and schedule_work(&port->bc_work) won't be
called. However, if port->bc_queue is full and port->bc_work is not
running or pending, port->bc_queue will keep full and schedule_work()
won't be called any more, and all broadcast skbs to macvlan will be
discarded. This case can happen:

macvlan_process_broadcast() is the pending function of port->bc_work,
it moves all the skbs in port->bc_queue to the queue "list", and
processes the skbs in "list". During this, new skbs will keep being
added to port->bc_queue in macvlan_broadcast_enqueue(), and
port->bc_queue may already full when macvlan_process_broadcast()
return. This may happen, especially when there are a lot of real-time
threads and the process is preempted.

Fix this by calling schedule_work(&port->bc_work) even if
port->bc_work is full in macvlan_broadcast_enqueue().
