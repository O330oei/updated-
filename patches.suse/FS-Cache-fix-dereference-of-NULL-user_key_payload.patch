Subject: [PATCH] FS-Cache: fix dereference of NULL user_key_payload
Git-commit: d124b2c53c7bee6569d2a2d0b18b4a1afde00134
Patch-mainline: v4.14-rc6
References: bsc#1052766

When the file /proc/fs/fscache/objects (available with
CONFIG_FSCACHE_OBJECT_LIST=y) is opened, we request a user key with
description "fscache:objlist", then access its payload.  However, a
revoked key has a NULL payload, and we failed to check for this.
request_key() *does* skip revoked keys, but there is still a window
where the key can be revoked before we access its payload.

Fix it by checking for a NULL payload, treating it like a key which was
already revoked at the time it was requested.
