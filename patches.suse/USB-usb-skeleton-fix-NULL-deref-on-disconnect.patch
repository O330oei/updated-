Subject: [PATCH] USB: usb-skeleton: fix NULL-deref on disconnect
Git-commit: bed5ef230943863b9abf5eae226a20fad9a8ff71
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc3
References: bsc#1051510

The driver was using its struct usb_interface pointer as an inverted
disconnected flag and was setting it to NULL before making sure all
completion handlers had run. This could lead to NULL-pointer
dereferences in the dev_err() statements in the completion handlers
which relies on said pointer.

Fix this by using a dedicated disconnected flag.

Note that this is also addresses a NULL-pointer dereference at release()
and a struct usb_interface reference leak introduced by a recent runtime
PM fix, which depends on and should have been submitted together with
this patch.

Fixes: 4212cd74ca6f ("USB: usb-skeleton.c: remove err() usage")
Fixes: 5c290a5e42c3 ("USB: usb-skeleton: fix runtime PM after driver unbind")
