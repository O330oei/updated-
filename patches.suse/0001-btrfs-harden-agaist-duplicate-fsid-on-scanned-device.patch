Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: harden agaist duplicate fsid on scanned devices

It's not that impossible to imagine that a device OR a btrfs image is
copied just by using the dd or the cp command. Which in case both the
copies of the btrfs will have the same fsid. If on the system with
automount enabled, the copied FS gets scanned.

We have a known bug in btrfs, that we let the device path be changed
after the device has been mounted. So using this loop hole the new
copied device would appears as if its mounted immediately after it's
been copied.

For example:

Initially.. /dev/mmcblk0p4 is mounted as /

  $ lsblk
  NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
  mmcblk0     179:0    0 29.2G  0 disk
  |-mmcblk0p4 179:4    0    4G  0 part /
  |-mmcblk0p2 179:2    0  500M  0 part /boot
  |-mmcblk0p3 179:3    0  256M  0 part [SWAP]
  `-mmcblk0p1 179:1    0  256M  0 part /boot/efi

  $ btrfs fi show
     Label: none  uuid: 07892354-ddaa-4443-90ea-f76a06accaba
     Total devices 1 FS bytes used 1.40GiB
     devid    1 size 4.00GiB used 3.00GiB path /dev/mmcblk0p4

Copy mmcblk0 to sda

  $ dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/dev/sda

And immediately after the copy completes the change in the device
superblock is notified which the automount scans using btrfs device scan
and the new device sda becomes the mounted root device.

  $ lsblk
  NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
  sda           8:0    1 14.9G  0 disk
  |-sda4        8:4    1    4G  0 part /
  |-sda2        8:2    1  500M  0 part
  |-sda3        8:3    1  256M  0 part
  `-sda1        8:1    1  256M  0 part
  mmcblk0     179:0    0 29.2G  0 disk
  |-mmcblk0p4 179:4    0    4G  0 part
  |-mmcblk0p2 179:2    0  500M  0 part /boot
  |-mmcblk0p3 179:3    0  256M  0 part [SWAP]
  `-mmcblk0p1 179:1    0  256M  0 part /boot/efi

  $ btrfs fi show /
    Label: none  uuid: 07892354-ddaa-4443-90ea-f76a06accaba
    Total devices 1 FS bytes used 1.40GiB
    devid    1 size 4.00GiB used 3.00GiB path /dev/sda4

The bug is quite nasty that you can't either unmount /dev/sda4 or
/dev/mmcblk0p4. And the problem does not get solved until you take sda
out of the system on to another system to change its fsid using the
'btrfstune -u' command.
