Subject: nvme: allow controller RESETTING to RECONNECTING transition
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc1
Git-commit: 3cec7f9de448131778a1428100621fd371db75f4
References: FATE#323952, FATE#322506

Transport will typically transition from LIVE to RESETTING when initially
performing a reset or recovering from an error.  Adding this transition
allows a transport to transition to RECONNECTING when it checks/waits for
connectivity then creates new transport connections and reinits the
controller.
