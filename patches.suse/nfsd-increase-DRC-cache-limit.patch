Subject: [PATCH] nfsd: increase DRC cache limit
Git-commit: 44d8660d3bb0a1c8363ebcb906af2343ea8e15f6
Patch-mainline: v4.15
References: bsc#1150381

An NFSv4.1+ client negotiates the size of its duplicate reply cache size
in the initial CREATE_SESSION request.  The server preallocates the
memory for the duplicate reply cache to ensure that we'll never fail to
record the response to a nonidempotent operation.

To prevent a few CREATE_SESSIONs from consuming all of memory we set an
upper limit based on nr_free_buffer_pages().  1/2^10 has been too
limiting in practice; 1/2^7 is still less than one percent.
