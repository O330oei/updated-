Subject: net/sched: act_sample: don't push mac header on ip6gre ingress
Git-commit: 92974a1d006ad8b30d53047c70974c9e065eb7df
Patch-mainline: 5.4-rc1
References: networking-stable-19_09_30

current 'sample' action doesn't push the mac header of ingress packets if
they are received by a layer 3 tunnel (like gre or sit); but it forgot to
check for gre over ipv6, so the following script:

 # tc q a dev $d clsact
 # tc f a dev $d ingress protocol ip flower ip_proto icmp action sample \
 > group 100 rate 1
 # psample -v -g 100

dumps everything, including outer header and mac, when $d is a gre tunnel
over ipv6. Fix this adding a missing label for ARPHRD_IP6GRE devices.
