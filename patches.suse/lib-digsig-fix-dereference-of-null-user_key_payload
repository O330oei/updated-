Subject: lib/digsig: fix dereference of NULL user_key_payload
Git-commit: 192cabd6a296cbc57b3d8c05c4c89d87fc102506
Patch-mainline: v4.14-rc6
References: bsc#1078860

digsig_verify() requests a user key, then accesses its payload.
However, a revoked key has a NULL payload, and we failed to check for
this.  request_key() *does* skip revoked keys, but there is still a
window where the key can be revoked before we acquire its semaphore.

Fix it by checking for a NULL payload, treating it like a key which was
already revoked at the time it was requested.
