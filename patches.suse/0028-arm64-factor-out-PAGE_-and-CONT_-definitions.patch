Subject: [PATCH 28/51] arm64: factor out PAGE_* and CONT_* definitions

Git-commit: b6531456ba279bb7cea5dd2e7b3ec6a3ed0f4668
Patch-mainline: v4.14-rc1
References: bsc#1068032

Some headers rely on PAGE_* definitions from <asm/page.h>, but cannot
include this due to potential circular includes. For example, a number
of definitions in <asm/memory.h> rely on PAGE_SHIFT, and <asm/page.h>
includes <asm/memory.h>.

This requires users of these definitions to include both headers, which
is fragile and error-prone.

This patch ameliorates matters by moving the basic definitions out to a
new header, <asm/page-def.h>. Both <asm/page.h> and <asm/memory.h> are
updated to include this, avoiding this fragility, and avoiding the
possibility of circular include dependencies.
