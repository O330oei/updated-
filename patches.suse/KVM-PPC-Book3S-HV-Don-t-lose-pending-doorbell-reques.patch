Subject: [PATCH] KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't lose pending doorbell request on
 migration on P9

References: bsc#1061840
Patch-mainline: v5.4-rc1
Git-commit: ff42df49e75f053a8a6b4c2533100cdcc23afe69

On POWER9, when userspace reads the value of the DPDES register on a
vCPU, it is possible for 0 to be returned although there is a doorbell
interrupt pending for the vCPU.  This can lead to a doorbell interrupt
being lost across migration.  If the guest kernel uses doorbell
interrupts for IPIs, then it could malfunction because of the lost
interrupt.

This happens because a newly-generated doorbell interrupt is signalled
by setting vcpu->arch.doorbell_request to 1; the DPDES value in
vcpu->arch.vcore->dpdes is not updated, because it can only be updated
when holding the vcpu mutex, in order to avoid races.

To fix this, we OR in vcpu->arch.doorbell_request when reading the
DPDES value.
