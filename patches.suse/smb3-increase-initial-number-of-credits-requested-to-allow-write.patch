Subject: [PATCH] smb3: increase initial number of credits requested to allow
 write
Git-commit: d409014e4feeab486fb36b350abfc4c94de8be37
Patch-mainline: v4.18-rc1
References: bsc#1144333

Compared to other clients the Linux smb3 client ramps up
credits very slowly, taking more than 128 operations before a
maximum size write could be sent (since the number of credits
requested is only 2 per small operation, causing the credit
limit to grow very slowly).

This lack of credits initially would impact large i/o performance,
when large i/o is tried early before enough credits are built up.
