Subject: [PATCH 2/2] regulator: fan53555: fix I2C device ids

Git-commit: fc1111b885437f374ed54aadda44d8b241ebd2a3
Patch-mainline: v4.14-rc1
References: bsc#1071296

The device tree nodes all correctly describe the regulators as
syr827 or syr828, but the I2C device id is currently set to the
wildcard value of syr82x in the driver.  This causes udev to fail
to match the driver module with the modalias data from sysfs.

Fix this by replacing the I2C device ids with ones that match the
device tree descriptions, with syr827 and syr828.  Tested on
Firefly rk3288 board.  The syr82x id was not used anywhere.
