Subject: [PATCH 1/1] tpm: Fix TPM 1.2 Shutdown sequence to prevent future TPM
 operations

References: bsc#1082555
Patch-mainline: v5.3-rc1
Git-commit: db4d8cb9c9f2af71c4d087817160d866ed572cc9

TPM 2.0 Shutdown involve sending TPM2_Shutdown to TPM chip and disabling
future TPM operations. TPM 1.2 behavior was different, future TPM
operations weren't disabled, causing rare issues. This patch ensures
that future TPM operations are disabled.

Fixes: d1bd4a792d39 ("tpm: Issue a TPM2_Shutdown for TPM2 devices.")
