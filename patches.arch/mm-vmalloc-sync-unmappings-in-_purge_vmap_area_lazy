Subject: mm/vmalloc: Sync unmappings in __purge_vmap_area_lazy()
Git-commit: 3f8fd02b1bf1d7ba964485a56f2f4b53ae88c167
Patch-mainline: v5.3-rc2
References: bsc#1118689

On x86-32 with PTI enabled, parts of the kernel page-tables are not shared
between processes. This can cause mappings in the vmalloc/ioremap area to
persist in some page-tables after the region is unmapped and released.

When the region is re-used the processes with the old mappings do not fault
in the new mappings but still access the old ones.

This causes undefined behavior, in reality often data corruption, kernel
oopses and panics and even spontaneous reboots.

Fix this problem by activly syncing unmaps in the vmalloc/ioremap area to
all page-tables in the system before the regions can be re-used.
