Subject: scsi: core: set result when the command cannot be dispatched
Git-commit: be549d49115422f846b6d96ee8fd7173a5f7ceb0
Patch-mainline: v5.1-rc6
References: git-fixes

When SCSI blk-mq is enabled, there is a bug in handling errors in
scsi_queue_rq.  Specifically, the bug is not setting result field of
scsi_request correctly when the dispatch of the command has been
failed. Since the upper layer code including the sg_io ioctl expects to
receive any error status from result field of scsi_request, the error is
silently ignored and this could cause data corruptions for some
applications.

Fixes: d285203cf647 ("scsi: add support for a blk-mq based I/O path.")
